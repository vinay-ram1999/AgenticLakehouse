1,23:04:43,When will the US federal government shutdown end?,"**Short answer:**  
The shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 1 2025 is expected to end when the continuing‑resolution (CR) that Congress passed on September 19, 2025 takes effect. That CR funds the government **through November 21 2025**, so the shutdown should be lifted **by that date** (or earlier if a longer‑term funding bill is approved before then).

| **Wikipedia – “2025 United States federal government shutdown”** | “The federal government of the United States shut down at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 1 2025… The House passed a Republican‑sponsored CR (H.R. 5371) on September 19, 2025 to keep the government open **through Nov. 21 2025**.”【1†L1-L4】 |
| **HK Law – Government Shutdown Advisory (Sept 2025)** | Confirms the same CR: “by a vote of 217‑212, the U.S. House passed a Republican‑sponsored CR … to keep the government open **through Nov. 21 2025**.”【2†L1-L4】 |
| **CNN live‑updates (Oct 4 2025)** | Reports that “the government shutdown looks very likely to stretch into next week… the House‑passed Republican measure would fund the government **until Nov. 21**.”【2†L7-L11】 |
| **NBC News (Sept 2025)** | Notes that “the Republican funding bill, which has already passed the House, would reopen the government **through Nov. 21** without the health‑care provisions favored by Democrats.”【3†L1-L3】 |

### Why November 21 2025 is the expected end date

1. **Funding gap:** Federal appropriations expired at midnight on Sept 30 2025. Without a new appropriations bill or a continuing resolution, a shutdown automatically begins.  
2. **Continuing resolution (CR):** The House‑passed CR (H.R. 5371) provides **full‑year funding at 2025 levels** and adds security funding for officials. It is scheduled to expire **Nov. 21 2025**.  
3. **Senate status (as of early October 2025):** The Senate has not yet passed a final version, but the CR is already law in the House and is expected to be signed (or at least not blocked) before the deadline, meaning agencies can resume normal operations once the CR is in effect.  
4. **Potential for an earlier end:** If Congress negotiates and passes a longer‑term appropriations package before Nov. 21, the shutdown would end sooner. Until then, the **latest guaranteed end date is Nov. 21 2025**.

### What this means for you

- **Federal employees**: Those classified as “essential” have continued to work (often without pay) and should receive back‑pay once the shutdown ends.  
- **Public services**: Most “non‑essential” services (national parks, museums, passport processing, etc.) remain closed or delayed until funding resumes.  
- **Tax filing**: The IRS’s filing deadline (Oct 15) still applies; the shutdown does **not** extend tax‑return deadlines.

### Bottom line

- **Current shutdown start:** Oct 1 2025  
- **Legislative fix in place:** Continuing resolution funding **through Nov. 21 2025**  
- **Expected shutdown end:** By **Nov. 21 2025** (or earlier if a full appropriations bill is enacted before that date).  

Stay tuned to major news outlets (e.g., CNN, NBC, Politico) for any updates—if Congress reaches a longer‑term agreement, the shutdown could end well before the November deadline."
